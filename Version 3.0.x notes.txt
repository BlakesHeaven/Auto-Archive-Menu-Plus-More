CHANGE HISTORY TO PLUGIN:

Changes for plugin version 3.11.0 - Configurable Sort Order - 17/02/2020
	Developed against Bludit v3.10.0 & tested against v3.11.0
	New - Both Parents and Children can be sorted either Ascending or Descending as directed by the Advanced General Setting, "Order content by" {Position/Date}. 
	Sort Order Configurable in Plugin Settings.
	Fixes an issue that needed the sorting of the menu reversing for the parents - especially in the Archive section to make sure the older items disappeared first.
	The array $publishedPagesByDate has been dropped because it does not have a 'rawDate' entity to be used by the sorting. 
	Now, "$parents = buildParentPages() " is used for both order by Date as well as order by Position. This reduced the code by quite a bit.
	Removed deprecated variables and code refactoring.

	Note: I used to keep different versions in seperate folders. I have now dropped older version folders from the repository since they are available from the releases.
	Now only the current version is activly held in code.

Changes for plugin version 3.9.0 - "Admin Stuff" section - 29/05/2019
    Fixes #4 ("Admin Stuff" section can't be restricted to logged in admin/editor) - Admin section functionality added back in!!

    Code tidied up so that if the user is not admin/editor role, then don't bother setting variables otherwise needed.

    Fixes #2 - Finished "Show fill-in text if nothing is found within the upcoming section" - new functionality.

    Dropdown menu added to 'Hidden' & 'Admin Stuff' category selection for ease of use - new functionality.

    Admin - Plugin configuration fields rearranged & formatted to fit better using two columns.


Changes for plugin version 3.0.0 (aka fixed for Bludit 3.0	- 06/10/2018
	amountOfItems	now	numberOfItems
	$Language	now	$L		- personally I'd prefer $Language, but keeping it in-sync.
	$Url		now	$url
	$Site		now	$site
	$dbPages	now	$pages
	$Login		now	$login
	$pagesByParent	now	$parents
	$pagesByChildren now	$children

	foreach ($staticPages as $pageKey) {	now	foreach ($staticPages as $page) {

	Added checks for empty Lables - if (!empty($staticLabel)) {
	added $staticPages = buildStaticPages();

	Fixed the "Order content by" date to actually order by date, was previously only by position.

	Removed "Admin Stuff" restriction to only show to Admin/Editors	because Bludit 3 can't identify loggedin user role.


Changes for plugin version 2.3.2 (aka Added Admin Section)	- 06/06/2018
	Added a new menu section so that if an Admin or Editor is logged in an extra 
	menu shows. Designed for Admin documentation to be added and hided from the public.
	NB: It's only a menu, pages are still accessible if the URL is know.
	Aimed at normal Published pages so that Parent/Child relationship can be adopted.
	Driven from a category of your choice. 


Changes for plugin version 2.3.1 (aka Fixed for Buldit 2.3)	- 06/05/2018
	Fixes to make compatible with Bludit Version 2.3.4

	The following changes were make in several places to plugin.php:
		Set all instances of "$Parent" to "$parent"; ie lower case "p".

	Also,
		$pagesByParent = buildParentPages();
		//foreach($pagesByParent[PARENT] as $Parent) {
		foreach($pagesByParent as $parent) {

		//if(!empty($pagesByParent[$Parent->key()])) {
		if ($parent->hasChildren()) {
		$pagesByChildren = $parent->children();

		//foreach($pagesByParent[$Parent->key()] as $child) {
		foreach ($pagesByChildren as $child) {
