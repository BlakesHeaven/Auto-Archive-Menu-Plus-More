Changes for plugin version 2.3.2 (aka Added Admin Section)	- 06/06/2018
	Added a new menu section so that if an Admin or Editor is logged in an extra 
	menu shows. Designed for Admin documentation to be added and hided from the public.
	NB: It's only a menu, pages are still accessible if the URL is know.
	Aimed at normal Published pages so that Parent/Child relationship can be adopted.
	Driven from a category of your choice.
