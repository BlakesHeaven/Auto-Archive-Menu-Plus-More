Mmm, I don't know yet and probably never will.

Changes:
 Fixes to make compatible with Bludit Version 2.3.4

The following changes were make in several places to plugin.php:
   Set all instances of "$Parent" to "$parent"; ie lower case "p".

Also,
  $pagesByParent = buildParentPages(); 			// 2.3.4 added
//foreach($pagesByParent[PARENT] as $Parent) { 			// 2.2.1 removed
  foreach($pagesByParent as $parent) {				// 2.3.4 added

//if(!empty($pagesByParent[$Parent->key()])) { 			// 2.2.1 removed
  if ($parent->hasChildren()) {				// 2.3.4 added
  $pagesByChildren = $parent->children();			// 2.3.4 added

//foreach($pagesByParent[$Parent->key()] as $child) {		// 2.2.1 removed
  foreach ($pagesByChildren as $child) {			// 2.3.4 added
