# Bludit Plugin: "Auto-Archive-Menu-Plus-More"

Think of a conveyor-belt...

... Published content moves through three different sections automatically based on the published DATE:
<ol><li>"Upcoming" menu section</li>
    <li>"Current" menu section</li>
    <li>"Archive" menu section</li>
</ol>

All sections are configurable:
<ul>
    <li>Set if the section is active or not (excluding "Current")</li>
    <li>Section label names can be changed</li>    
    <li>Set if children should show or not</li>    
    <li>For each independent section, set the duration of time (weeks at the moment) content appears in it</li>
    <li>What to do about nothing? Automatically shows or hides the section label if no content is found</li>
    <li>Fill-in text if nothing is found and label is shown <-- in progress.</li>
    <li>If "Upcoming" menu section is disabled, "Current" menu section automatically starts immediately.</li>
</ul>

Oh yes; there are a few more features as well...
<ul>
    <li>Hide pages with a named Category.</li>
    <li>A built in "Static Menu" - based off the standard Bludit "Static Menu" plug-in, but honoring the hidden pages category.</li>
    <li>Enable/Disable Home page withing Static Pages</li>
</ul>

Built initially to auto-archive a programme of events for a concert club after a number of weeks had elapsed but became a little more than that.
