# Bludit Plugin: "Auto-Archive-Menu-Plus-More"

Think of a conveyor-belt...

... Published content moves through three different sections automatically based on the published DATE:
<ul><li>"Upcoming" menu section</li>
		<li>"Current" menu section and finally to the</li>
		<li>"Archive" menu section</li></ul>

All sections are configurable: 
<ul>
	<li>Set if the section is active or not</li>
	<li>Section label names can be changed</li>	
	<li>Set if children should show or not</li>	
	<li>For each independent section, set the duration of time (weeks at the moment) content appears in it</li>
	<li>What to do about nothing? show or hide the section lable if no content found</li>

</ul>

Oh yes; there's a few more features as well...
<ul>
	<li>Hide pages with a named Category.</li>
	<li>A built in "Static Menu" - based off the standard Bludit "Static Menu" plugin, but honouring the hidden pages category.</li>
	<li>Enable/Diable Home page withing Statice Pages</li>
</ul>
